# cigarplotter
A visualization tool for fragment recruitment plots generated by processing large metagenomic datasets for read coverage

Project initially completed in October 2022 for the Practical Introduction to Metagenomics course offered at Johns Hopkins University and taught by Joshua Orvis

The included scripts are designed with an expectation of properly formatted sequence alignments generated using the Bowtie2 (https://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/bowtie2/index.shtml) and FR-HIT (https://github.com/Beifang/fr-hit) tool suites, then processing these outputs into clear visualizations of many thousands of alignments to display the metagenomic dataset's coverage of a given known gene sequence.
